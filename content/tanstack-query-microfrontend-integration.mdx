This guide provides detailed instructions for integrating `@tanstack/react-query` into a React Native micro app using **Repack**. By leveraging Webpack through Repack, you gain access to advanced bundling techniques while ensuring compatibility with the CommonJS (CJS) format, which works more reliably within the React Native ecosystem.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have:
- **Node.js** and **npm/yarn** installed.
- A React Native project set up to use Repack for Webpack-based bundling.
- Basic familiarity with Webpack configurations and Repack.

---

## Step 1: Install TanStack Query

Install `@tanstack/react-query` using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query
```

This installs TanStack Query, providing powerful utilities for managing data fetching and caching within your micro app. This guide will focus on using the **CommonJS (CJS)** version to ensure compatibility in the React Native environment.

---

## Step 2: Configure Webpack with Repack for CJS Compatibility

Configure Webpack to prioritize **CommonJS (CJS)** modules for TanStack Query. This approach ensures better compatibility in React Native by using a CJS-based setup.

Open your Webpack configuration file (usually `webpack.config.mjs`) and configure the module handling, especially for CJS.

You can find an example Webpack configuration file [here](https://github.com/joelshejar/repack-examples-tanstack-query/blob/main/module-federation/app1/webpack.config.mjs).

### Key Configuration Details

1. **CJS Compatibility for `@tanstack/react-query`**:
   - Ensure `@tanstack` files are processed correctly by specifying their paths in the Babel loader configuration.
   - The configuration includes the use of `@babel/plugin-transform-private-methods` to support private methods within `@tanstack`, a requirement for compatibility in environments that do not natively support certain JavaScript features.

2. **Babel Configuration for React Native and TanStack**:
   - Includes `babel-loader` to transpile JavaScript and TypeScript files, ensuring that React Native and `@tanstack/react-query` dependencies are compatible with React Native.
   - The `include` paths ensure that `@tanstack` dependencies are processed correctly, avoiding runtime issues.

---

## Step 3: Create a Query Client

Each micro app can have its own `QueryClient` instance, allowing each app to manage data caching and request handling independently. This modular approach prevents unintended data sharing and keeps micro apps self-contained.

You can view an example implementation of the `App` component [here](https://github.com/joelshejar/repack-examples-tanstack-query/blob/main/module-federation/app1/src/App.tsx).

### Example:

```javascript
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export const App = () => (
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    {/* Your App Components */}
  </QueryClientProvider>
);
```

---

## Step 4: Use TanStack Query Hooks in Your Components

With your QueryClient set up, you can now use TanStack Query’s hooks (like `useQuery` and `useMutation`) to fetch and manage data in your components.

You can find a complete implementation of `DataComponent` using TanStack Query [here](https://github.com/joelshejar/repack-examples-tanstack-query/blob/main/module-federation/app1/src/DataComponent.tsx).

### Example Usage of `useQuery`:

```javascript
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { Text } from 'react-native';

const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return response.json();
};

const DataComponent = () => {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(['dataKey'], fetchData);

  if (isLoading) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
  if (error) return <Text>Error loading data</Text>;

  return <Text>{JSON.stringify(data)}</Text>;
};
```

---

## Step 5: Troubleshooting and Best Practices

1. **Prioritize CJS for Compatibility**:
   - Ensure the Webpack configuration processes TanStack Query as **CommonJS** to avoid compatibility issues in React Native.
   - Avoid mixing ESM and CJS formats within the same setup to prevent runtime errors.

2. **Private Method Transform**:
   - Include the `@babel/plugin-transform-private-methods` plugin in Babel’s configuration to ensure `@tanstack` libraries work correctly, as some internal methods may rely on private fields and methods.

3. **React Refresh for HMR (Optional)**:
   - If using Hot Module Replacement (HMR) during development, ensure `react-refresh/babel` is configured within `babel-loader` to see live updates without a full refresh.

---

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you have successfully integrated TanStack Query into your React Native micro app using Repack with an emphasis on **CommonJS (CJS)** compatibility. Each micro app manages its own QueryClient, ensuring modularity and self-containment without shared instances. This setup maximizes compatibility within the React Native ecosystem and avoids issues related to ESM/CJS interop, making it a stable foundation for data fetching and caching in microfrontends. 

This approach is particularly suited for modular architectures, where self-contained micro apps need isolated state and minimal dependencies on shared modules.
